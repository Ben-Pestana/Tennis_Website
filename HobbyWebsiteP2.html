					<h1> History</h1>
				<p>Tennis was believed to be invented by the Egyptians. The name "tennis" 
				was derived from the Egyptian town of Tinnis located alongside the Nile River.
				The word "racquet" evolved from the Arabic word for Palm of the hand. Monks would shout the word
				"tenez" which is the French word for to take whenever they served the ball. By the 13th century
				there were as many as 1,800 indoor courts. The game became so popular that several members of the
				church tried to ban the game. As tennis became more popular, it evolved, the courtyard playing 
				courts were modified into indoor courts, and the tennis balls which were originally wooden, 
				transformed into leather balls filled with cellulose. The game was originally played with the hand 
				but people started wearing gloves or even webbing between the fingers. This eventually evolved 
				to the racquet in the 1500s. At the time a racquet was a wooden frame laced with sheep gut.

				 <p>Games were extremely different from what we call "real tennis" today. The games were played
				 in a narrow indoor court where the ball was played off walls. Players would win points by hitting
				 the ball into netted windows with the net being 5 feet high and 3 feet in the middle. Later in 
				 1850 Charles Goodyear invented a process for rubber called vulcanisation which made the balls
				 bouncier. This made the game move outside on grass. The foundation for tennis was finally set. 
				 Walter C. Wingfield designed a court that looked like an hourglass and was shorter than an average
				 court. However his rules were subjected to criticism so he revised them in 1875 and left the 
				 project to the others.

				<p>In the beginning, men were the only ones allowed to play in tournaments. Wimbledon also known as 
				lawn tennis became super popular and held it's first tournament in 1877. Tennis spread to the United States
				in 1874 by a women named Mary Ewing Outerbridge. She was introduced to tennis by a friend while she was
				vacationing in Bermuda. She came back home to New York and built the first tennis court in America. 
				The first tournament in America was held in Newport Rhode Island in 1881 for men only. Six years later 
				they expanded tournaments to women as well. In 1900 the international team competition called the Davis Cup
				began. Tennis was usually restricted to country clubs until 1930 when the government started to build courts
				on school grounds to make tennis more accessible to the public. Tennis was then finally added to the Olympics
				in 1988. Today the four major tournaments in tennis are the U.S Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the Australian
				Open.
