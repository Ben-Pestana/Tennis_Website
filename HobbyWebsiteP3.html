				<h1> Techniques</h1>
					<p> All strokes in tennis have a specific way of moving towards the 
					ball and making contact, as well as applying different spins, using different techniques.

					<p> Topspin is a technique that creates a forward rolling type spin in the air. Many shots in tennis use topspin, including forehand
					backhand and serve.  The grip for a forehand 
					can vary but all the grips have some things in common.  One thing is that it is only one hand at the
					bottom of the racket grip, the other being that if you want to generate spin, you only
					Shown to the right, topspin gives the ball more arch, then pulls it down into the court.
					To hit topspin, come over the top of the ball, brushing the back upward to create a forward spin effect.  
					If done right you can hit a tennis ball twice as hard as hitting a ball flat, and 
					still have it go in hard.  To get a more straight angle, so the ball is not as
					bloopy and slow in the air, just swing faster, because it spins the ball faster, therefore 
					pulling the ball to the ground faster, so it goes in hard and fast.

					<p> Footwork is a huge part in the tennis game. One technique used in tennis is called the split step. This is a 
					small "jump" used to prepare you for the oncoming shot. You split step before each shot is hit. Split 
					steps are especially useful when you volley since the ball is coming at you really fast and gives you 
					little time to react. Some drills to help you with your footwork are working with ladders, not the kind 
					you use to climb up heights, a flat ladder that lays on the ground. There are different exercises that 
					you can run through to improve such as two-in-two out and just sprinting through without touching it. 
					Another step called karaoke or grape vine is used too. It is used when backing up for overheads since its
					faster than shuffling. Shuffling is another part of footwork. After every shot you want to shuffle back to
					the middle because it gets you in position to split step and prepare for the next shot.
					</p>
					
					<p> Backspin is a technique that is used only in a few shots.  The shots are forehand and backhand slice, and the dropshot.  
					When hitting backspin, it is exactly how it sounds, it is the opposite of topspin.  Instead of brushing up on the ball, 
					you want to come under the ball and have your racket face at angle, not straight up and not straight at the net, just in the middle.
					Backspin creates a rolling backwards motion in the air, so it looks like the ball is rolling the wrong way in the air.  If done
					correctly, the ball, instead of following a normal trajectory contiuosly moving forward, it lands and because of the backspin, jumps up 
					more and goes less forward.
