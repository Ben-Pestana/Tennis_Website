				<h1>Strokes</h1>
			 <h3 align="center">Forehand</h3>
					<p>	The first stroke in tennis is the forehand, one of the most used strokes
					in a match.  To hit a forehand, you pull the racket back to your side (outwards) and plant your legs then
					swing foreward through the ball, and finishing with the racket over your shoulder. It is like swinging your arm 
					across your body and over your shoulder.  When swinging the racket, you want to 
					watch the ball and make contact out in front.  Contacting in front gives you 
					more power and makes the ball spin in more.  This stroke uses topspin
					to make the ball have a higher percentage going in. 
					</p>

					<h3 align="center">Backhand</h3>
					<p> "The next stroke in tennis, which happens to also use topspin, is the backhand.  There are two versions
					of the backhand, one handed and two handed.  The two handed backhand has both hands on the racket, 
					with the dominant (or whichever hand is used for forehand) at the bottom, and the other hand just above it.
					For a backhand, you generate spin by brushing the ball upwards and forwards the other side of the court.  
					When hitting the two handed backhand, you want to let the (if you are right handed) left hand guide the stroke 
					over around your body outstretched then over your shoulder into the finish.  
					</p>
					<h3 align="center"> Serving </h3>
					<p> Serving is the most important shot in the game. You have to be able to serve in order 
					to start a point. The serve consists of four parts. The toss, trophy position, swing, and 
					finish. Depending on what kind of serve you are aiming for. For beginners toss the ball over your head and slightly
					infront of you. Make sure your grip is continental not western/eastern (See Picture Right)
					</p>

					<p> Once you have the grip down, as you throw the ball, get into trophy position. Trophy position is when the racquet is
					dropped behind your head (relaxed) "scratch your back" and the ball about 2 feet above the head (varies for each person 
					and type of serve). When the ball is at its highest point, strike it with your racquet in order to maximize power. 
					When serving, keep your feet parallel to the baseline, and make sure they do not cross the baseline
					otherwise it is considered a fault.  Every point you get two serves, a first which is generally harder with more power, 
					and the second serve is less powerful and has more topspin.  Every point you switch the side your serving on. ON the court there is a small center
					line to tell you which side you are on. If you are playing singles then you want to serve towards the center of the court since you 
					have to cover more ground. However if you are playing doubles then you should serve towards the doubles ally to avoid hitting your
					partner.

					<p> There are multiple types of serves, including the kick, slice, and flat. A kick serve is when you toss the ball directly above
					your head to allow more spin hence the "kick" name. Your grip doesn't change however the timing is slightly different. 
					Instead of hitting down on the ball like you would on a regular serve you want to brush up on the ball creating topspin to give
					the ball a kick.
					</p>
					<p> The next kind of serve is the slice serve. The toss on this serve is a little different than kick, 
					more out in front and to the right (if you are left handed, it is the opposite), but the grip stays the same.
					When hitting the ball, you want to come around the ball on the right (Again, opposite for left handed peoples), and
					hit through the ball, finishing by your waist.  
					</p>
					<p> The flat serve is the easiest however least safe serve. Grip the racquet using continental and "tap"  the ball in. 
					Another way to hit a flat serve is to have and open face and hit down on the ball. For this serve you want to hit the back of the 
					ball with little or no spin. If you are a beginner then you would most likely start off with this serve. 
					</p>
					<h3 align="center">Volleys, Overheads, and Slices</h3>
					<p> The volley, overhead, and slice all use the same grip: continental. Volleys are usually hit in the middle of the service box.
					Have your racquet up like your sword fighting gripping the racquet with two hands. The motion is just like you're giving someone a
					high-five. Backhand volleys can be hit with one or two hands just like a backhand. It is a short punching motion rather than swinging 
					at the ball (most people make this mistake).
					Overheads are hit just like serves. When the ball is in the air get into trophy position and use your other arm to point at the 
					ball. If you see the ball going over your head then you can karaoke back. When hitting an overhead, make sure to position yourself so
					the ball is infront of you. This helps you with timing and hitting down on the ball so it stays in the court. It is way easier to run
					forward if you backed up too much rather than to run backwards and try and hit a good shot. 
					Slicing is a more complicated shot however once you get the hang of it, you can have more style in your game. Slicing is a short
					chopping kind of motion. In order to create backspin on the ball you have to hit from slightly underneath rather than hitting the
					backside of the ball. Slicing is used to make your opponent run and mess up their shot. Most of the game is played using topspin 
					but backspin can create variation in the game.
