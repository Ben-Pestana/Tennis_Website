					<p> The scoring in tennis isn't your average scoring system like in soccer. In tennis the scores dont go up 
					at a constant rate. The game begins at 0-0 or some say "love all". This phrase came to be since tennis is a 
					gentlemans sport. The server calls his score first followed by the returner's score. The score after the first
					point can be 0-15 or 15-0. If you keep winning then the scores should be 30-0, 40-0 and the next point you win.
					However if you are playing and the score ends up 40-40 this is called "deuce". If you are playing with no ads' then 
					the returner decides the side you serve on. If you are playing with ads then you have to win by two. If you win
					the point at deuce then you would say "ad-in". If you lost the point then you would say "ad-in". A normal set is
					the first person to win 6 games or win by two if the set score is 5 all. If the score ends up to be 6 all then 
					you play a game called a tie breaker. In this game you switch servers when the scores add up to odd numbers versus
					even numbers.

					<p> When scoring for sets, usually a set is first to six games, but in some matches, the sets are first to eight.  
					In most professional tournaments, they play two out of three sets, so basically it is first to two sets wins.  
					In some major tournaments though, they play best three out of five, which means first to three sets wins.    
					</p>
					
					<p> When serving in tennis you stand behind the baseline, which shown to the left, is the furthest line from the net.
					If your foot crosses the line before you hit the ball, it is called a foot fault and you automatically lose the point.
					Also when serving you are trying to make it into the opposite serving box.  If you are serving on deuce side, in front of 
					the right box, then you are trying to make it into the right box on the other side of the court.  Every point you switch the side your serving on. 
					On the court there is a small center line to tell you which side you are on. If you are playing singles then you want to serve towards the center of the court since you 
					have to cover more ground. However if you are playing doubles then you should serve closer towards the doubles ally to avoid hitting your
					partner or to get a better angle while serving.
